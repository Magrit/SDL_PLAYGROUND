# SDL_SPECIAL_BARNACLE


A non-serious sandbox for some 2D OpenGL SDL implementation.

Trying my best to contain a somewhat ease of read. C++ based and with some finesse like hot-reloading of shaders.

For this project I will probably not dance around with a cross-platform build system, but instead I will try to keep it as is.
